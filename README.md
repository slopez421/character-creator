# Site of Holding

As an avid lover of tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons, I sought out to make a simple character creator application where the user could input the details of their fantasy character without needing to look at a piece of paper.  We all know the stress of having to attend a game session and suddenly losing your physical character sheet at the last minute. 

Well, what if you didn't need a physical copy?
What if your character, and every character you create, is stored digitally in one location? 

Gone are the days of shielding your character sheet from spilled water when you can simply use the Site of Holding to digitally store your information. 

On the home page, users can navigate between the character Races page and the character Archetypes page to read about the various options for their character. The beauty of this project is that you don't need to be a TTRPG expert to make a character! Using the D&D 5e API, the Races and Archetypes pages pulls basic information about your possible choices so you can create a character while being well-informed about your options. 

Once the user inputs their character's information using the Create-A-Character form, a character card is displayed on the page with the same information.

If the user decides to remove that character or simply made a mistake during creation, they can also click the trash icon and delete that character from their adventuring party.
