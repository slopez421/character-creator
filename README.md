# Character Creator App

As an avid lover of tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons, I sought out to make a simple character creator application where the user could input the details of their fantasy character without needing to look at a piece of paper.  We all know the stress of having to attend a game session and suddenly losing your physical character sheet at the last minute. 

Well what if you didn't need a physical copy?
